This zip file contains optional bundles in the addons folder that can be 
manually added to the openHAB runtime by simply copying them 
to ${openhab.home}/addons.

Additionally, you will find the configuration files in the conf/services folder.
Simply copy the ones for the addons that you use to ${openhab.home}/conf/services
and fill in your personal configuration settings.

Each bundle (jar file) is a feature that can be installed independently from
any other bundle in this zip file.
You can thus decide yourself, what features you need and leave out the rest.
